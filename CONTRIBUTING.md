# Contributing to PirateBox

So you want to contribute.
Bold. Reckless. Admirable.

This project runs on caffeine, stubbornness, and the faint hope that someone else fixes bugs before I see them.

Here’s how to help without setting the place on fire.

## 1. Before You Touch Anything

* Read the README.
* Search existing issues.
* Assume someone already tried your "brilliant" idea in 2019.

If it already exists, add context instead of opening Issue #437: "it broke??"

## 2. Coding Expectations

Keep it simple.

* Small changes > heroic rewrites
* Clear names > clever names
* Working code > intellectual performance art

If your function needs a novel-length comment, rewrite the function.

## 3. Style

Match the existing code style.

Do not reformat the entire repo because your editor has opinions. Nobody asked your linter to redecorate the house.

## 4. Commit Messages

Human readable. Please.

Good:

* fix: handle timeout on device handshake
* feat: add retry for telemetry upload

Bad:

* stuff
* update
* lol

## 5. Pull Requests

* One change per PR
* Explain what you did and why
* Include logs/screenshots if relevant
* Test your code (yes, actually run it)

If it breaks everything and you say "works on my machine", your machine is now the problem.

## 6. Behavior

Be respectful. Collaborators are people, not NPCs.

Disagree with ideas, not humans.

If you feel the urge to start a flame war, go outside. Touch grass. Hydrate.

## 7. Maintainer Reality

Responses may be slow.

This is not a VC-funded startup. It's spare-time engineering.

Patience dramatically increases your odds of getting merged.

## 8. The Spirit of the Project

Build useful things.
Keep things hackable.
Don't make future-us hate present-you.

## Final Rule

Help make the repo better than you found it.
That's it. No rituals. No secret handshake.
Just competence and basic decency.
