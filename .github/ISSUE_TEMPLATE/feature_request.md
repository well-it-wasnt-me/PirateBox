## Summary

Describe the feature in one or two clear sentences.

If this section reads like a manifesto, it probably needs to be smaller.

## Problem Statement

What problem does this solve?

If the answer is "it would be cool", explain *why* it would be cool in a way that doesn’t rely on vibes.

## Proposed Solution

What are you suggesting?

* New endpoint?
* Config flag?
* Architectural upheaval?

Be specific. "Make it better" is not an implementation plan.

## Alternatives Considered

Did you explore other approaches?

Sometimes the feature already exists and just needs documentation. Sometimes it’s a 3-line patch. Sometimes it’s a multi-week rewrite that nobody is volunteering for.

## Impact

* Who benefits?
* Does this add complexity?
* Does this break compatibility?

Every feature has a cost. Convince us this one is worth paying for.

## Additional Context

Mockups, logs, diagrams, references, benchmarks. The more concrete, the less guesswork.

## Checklist

* [ ] I searched existing issues and feature requests
* [ ] This is not a support question
* [ ] I explained the problem clearly
* [ ] I understand maintainers may say no

Open source is collaborative, not contractual.
Make the case. Keep it sharp. Keep it realistic.
